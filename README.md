# Gallery-Cart

This was a vanilla JS learning project for using APIs and also 
incorporating basic "e-commerce" functionality (ie. a cart). 
Other concepts such as "global state", using web components and 
rendering modal images from thumbnails were also practiced. 

It is live at: https://aa-coding.github.io/Gallery-Cart/

Because there are 2 pages, a home page and a cart/favourites page,
this project also includes a basic vanilla JS router function.

The project does not use session storage, so reloading the page does
erase the page results and clear the user's cart/favourites. 

I greatly appreciate the time and feedback of all those who have 
provided generous assistance along my web dev journey.
